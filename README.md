## How to Use

WIP

## Tips, Suggestions and Rules

1. Every folder that contains code which contributes to the bot **MUST** have a `__init__.py` file.
2. Fill out `default-config.yaml` and rename it to `config.yaml`
3. Use `black` as a handy formatter to format your code.

``` 
# Windows
pip install black
black .

# Linux
python3 -m pip install black
python3 -m black .
```
